# Getting and celaning data project 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Requirements: 
1. A tidy data set as described below, 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md.** 

## Sample and collection
The data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist:

1. Walking
2. Walking upstairs
3. Walking downstairs
4. Sitting
5. Standing
6. Laying

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

## Proyect 
We should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
